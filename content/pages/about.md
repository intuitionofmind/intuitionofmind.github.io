Hi, here is Wayne Zheng (郑伟).
Currently I am a postdoc researcher majoring theoretical quantum matter physics in the Ohio State University.
Mainly I do research within the field of strongly correlated quantum systems, both analytically and computationally.
I am also interested in various related problems of statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.

Besides physics, I am also interested in philosophy, some essaies and articles about these written in Chinese can be found here.
I am a sparetime road cyclist and sometimes I also taste triathlon.
